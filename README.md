# NodeJS and MySQL
In this repository I will show you a quick example of how to implement MySQL in a NodeJS application. If you understand the working of MySQL in NodeJS and are wondering how to apply this into your Discord bot for example, please check out my other repository: [DiscordJS-MySQL](https://github.com/HalloSouf/DiscordJS-MySQL)

Before you asking around and ask yourself questions, pay attention to the following things:
* You have some understanding of SQL queries [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/)
* You have basic understanding of Javascript for using MySQL
* You know how a MySQL database works

## Packages
The only thing you need to install with NPM is the **mysql** package. You can download this with:
> npm install mysql

**Documentation:** https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql
